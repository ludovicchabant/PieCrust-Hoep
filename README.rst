This plugin for `PieCrust`_ lets you use `Hoedown Markdown`_ via `Hoep`_ for
faster Markdown processing. It's much faster than the default pure Python (but
more universal) Markdown formatter that comes by default with PieCrust. It
should be totally compatible with it, however, in the sense that dropping this
plugin in your website should make it bake faster with no discernable change.
